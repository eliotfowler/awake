Awake
=====

The iOS 7 Alarm Clock is missing essential features. Awake aims to solve that problem.

*NOTE*: Awake is currently in a non-working state as it is still in initial development.

Features
--------

Awake is styled very similarly to the native iOS 7 alarm clock. Here are some of the additional features that Awake has:

* Better repeat selection
    * You can choose certain days by clicking on them
    * You can also choose between weekdays, weekends, or every day
    * You are given a human-readable sentence about which days it will repeat.
* Unlimited Alarms
* Amazing sounds (coming soon)
* Snooze length modification. This is a must. 9 minutes pleases no one.
* More to come.
